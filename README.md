TBase project: App  Angular
**The objective of this project is to have an initial base app in which to start an Angular 8 project to make new Developer test applications.**

This base app contains the following:
 - Initial base (Angular 8 + Node 12).
 - Integration with  Bootstrap Style Guide.
 - Making HTTP requests.
 - Routes.node
 
 ## Starting a new app from this project
1. Duplicate the repository in GitLab (from the _master_ branch) to generate the base of the new App.
2. Clone the repository locally to start development.
3. Run `npm install` from terminal in the project folder to install the modules you need.
4. Perform an `npm audit fix` to install updates for packages that have vulnerabilities.
6. Launch the project with `ng serve` from the command line.
7. Access from the browser to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/), the development server. The application will automatically reload if changes are made to the code.
8. Modify the name of the app in the `<title>Developer test</title>` of the index.html file.
9. Change the app style in the configuration file **\src\app\config\config.ts** (for example: `app-crm`).
10. This will dynamically change the color of the top navigation bar and all the links that we add (a CSS class is automatically added to the `body` (`<body class="app-crm">`).
11. Include HTML elements in the Angular components with the specific class of the App (the same configured previously) so that they take the corresponding styles; as explained in the [style guide](http://styleguide.preving.com/docs/4.3/applications/custom-components/).
